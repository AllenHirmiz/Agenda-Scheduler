## Agenda Scheduler Website
This repository was created to allow the users that are in the page to schedule their day from 9 AM to 5 PM with the ability to add a new agenda, modify or clear the entre.

This project only contain one main page, the main page will display agenda calendar view for the day, 1 row for each hour, and each row will contain the time of the day, Text area to input or display their agenda and a save button.  

This project is mainly focused on showing up my skills in JS third party API's that are available to use, and to improve on it as I progress through my learning journey.
